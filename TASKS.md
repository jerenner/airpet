## In Progress

- None.

## Recently Completed

- **Preflight cycle detection for LV/assembly placement hierarchy** (2026-03-10)
  - Added deterministic graph traversal in `ProjectManager.run_preflight_checks()` to detect recursive placement loops across:
    - logical volume → logical volume
    - logical volume ↔ assembly
    - assembly ↔ assembly
  - New preflight error code: `placement_hierarchy_cycle` with explicit cycle path diagnostics (e.g. `LV:A -> ASM:B -> LV:A`).
  - Added cycle de-duplication + deterministic ordering for stable summaries/fingerprints.
  - Added regression tests in `tests/test_preflight.py` for both LV↔LV and LV↔ASM loops.
  - Why: recursive placement loops are high-impact topology faults that can silently poison traversal/export logic and are hard to debug without explicit path-level reporting.

- **Preflight integrity hardening for world/placement references** (2026-03-10)
  - Added new preflight error checks for:
    - missing `world_volume_ref`
    - unknown `world_volume_ref`
    - missing placement `volume_ref`
    - unknown placement `volume_ref` (LV/assembly not found)
    - world volume incorrectly referenced as a child placement
  - Added regression tests in `tests/test_preflight.py` to lock behavior.
  - Why: these are simulation-blocking topology problems that should fail fast in deterministic preflight instead of surfacing later during run/export.

## Next Candidates

1. **Version selection diagnostics for preflight compare endpoints**
   - Include explicit ordering metadata (`ordering_basis`, timestamps, source path checks) in compare/list responses.
   - Impact: medium-high (improves reproducibility/debugging for AI + human workflows).

2. **Preflight check for procedural volume references (replica/division/parameterised)**
   - Validate referenced target volumes exist and bounds are sane before simulation.
   - Impact: medium (catches stale references outside plain `physvol`).
