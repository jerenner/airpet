    <p>
        <strong>Disclaimer of Warranty:</strong>
        AIRPET is an open-source tool under active development and has not been formally verified or validated for accuracy, reliability, or safety. It is provided "as is" without any warranty, express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Some results may depend on underlying tools like Geant4 and parallelproj—users must independently verify simulations and reconstructions.

    <p>
        <strong>Intended Use:</strong> 
        This tool is intended for research and educational purposes only. It is NOT suitable for clinical, diagnostic, or medical decision-making. We make no claims regarding the accuracy of geometries, simulations, or reconstructions. Users assume all risks associated with its use.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Session Cookie:</strong> We use a temporary, essential cookie to maintain your unique session and isolate your project data from other users.</li>
            <li><strong>API Keys:</strong> If you provide a Google Gemini API key, it is stored temporarily within your encrypted session cookie to process your AI requests. It is not stored on our server's filesystem.</li>
            <li><strong>User Prompts & Geometry Data:</strong> Your geometry data and any prompts you send to the AI assistant are processed on our server and may be sent to third-party AI providers to fulfill your request.</li>
            <li><strong>Server Logs:</strong> Our hosting provider (Render) may collect standard server logs, which can include your IP address.</li>

            <li>AI features using Gemini models send data to Google. You can view Google's AI privacy policy <a href="https://ai.google.dev/terms" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Data Retention:</strong> All user sessions, project data, and simulation results are ephemeral and will be deleted from our server after a period of inactivity (typically one hour) or when the server instance restarts.
